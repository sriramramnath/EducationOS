# Google Login & Signup with Django

This tutorial will teach you all you need to know to get started with authenticating your users with google. This tutorial does assume you have your project setup already

## Getting Started

### 1. Opening django project

- I am going to assume you have a django project created already
- Open your project in your code editor

### 2. Create a new project on google
- Head to google cloud consle below:
    ```https://console.cloud.google.com/```

- Click on the project tab and select 'New Project'

- Give your project a name and click create

- Wait for project to get created

### 3. Setup OAUTH Consent Screen

This is where we setup what a user sees when they click 'Signin with google'. We need to set this up before we can get OAuth credentials

- Select project after it has been created

- Expand navigation menu on the left and select:
    - APIs & Services > OAuth Consent Screen

- Under user type, select external & click Create

- Under the form, 
    - Fill in app name & select user support email
    - Upload a logo (optional)
    - optionally add app domains 
    - We will leave authorized domains for now
    - Fill in a developer contact info
    - click save and continue

- Next we need to add scopes for the information we want to get access to from the google account:
    - Click Add or remove scopes
    - Select the first 2 options (These will give us access to information lile a user's email, name, profile photo, ....)
    - Click update
    - Click save and continue

- Adding test users:
    - We can skip this step because we will successfully be able to login without adding an email as a test user 

    - Click save and continue

- Summary
    - Make sure all the info are correct
    - Back to dashboard

We are going to make use of these credentials in our django project 

- Click credentials in the side nav

    ```Create credentials > OAuth client Id```

- Appication type should be web application

- Next, we ned to fill authorised redirect url:
    - Add the following URIs:
        ```http://127.0.0.1:8000```
        ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/```

    @receiver(user_signed_up)
    def handle_user_signed_up(request, sociallogin, user, **kwargs):

        # grab the user's data
        new_user_data = sociallogin.account.extra_data

        print(new_user_data)

        # perform tasks/processing on data

    ```

- Import signal into ```app.py``` file:
    ```python
    from django.apps import AppConfig

    class CoreConfig(AppConfig):
        default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
        name = 'Core'

        # create ready method
        def ready(self):
            # import signals
            import Core.signals
    ```
